I have successfully completed a comprehensive full-stack software engineering bootcamp through Springboard at the University of Massachusetts Global, involving over 800 hours of intensive curriculum training. For my capstone project, I built a full-stack web application leveraging the Open Library API with Node.js and React.js.

In addition to my software engineering training, my academic background includes a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Capella University and an Associate Degree in Nursing from Denver College of Nursing. These educational experiences have equipped me with a robust understanding of the healthcare industry and skills that have proven invaluable in high-pressure, fast-paced environments. As a registered nurse in various hospital settings, I honed my communication, teamwork, and critical thinking abilities, all of which I have effectively applied in my transition to software engineering.

My technical skill set comprises proficiency in JavaScript and Python, experience with SQL and PSQL databases, and familiarity with tools and frameworks such as RESTful APIs, Insomnia, AJAX, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Express.js, HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Node.js, Flask, React, Bootstrap, and jQuery. I am also adept at testing methodologies, with practical experience using Jest, SuperTest, Unit Testing, and Jasmine.
