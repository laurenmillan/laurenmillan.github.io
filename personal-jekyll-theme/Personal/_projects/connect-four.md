## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player game, with players taking turns to drop a coin into any of the seven columns in the game board. The game ends when a player gets four of their colored coins in a row, or when the board fills and the game is a tie.

The game was built using pure JavaScript for game logic, HTML for structure and CSS for styling. It demonstrates understanding of concepts such as DOM manipulation, control structures, and event handling in JavaScript.
