## Overview

In this project, I developed a front-end interface that enables users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN using the Open Library API. The back-end integrates user registration and login functionalities, leveraging PostgreSQL for database management. Once registered, users can view, save, and remove books from their personal saved list.

See the back-end code in my [Github repository](https://github.com/mlauren77/novel-pursuit-backend) and the front-end code [here](https://github.com/mlauren77/novel-pursuit-frontend)
