## Overview

Jobly is a dynamic full-stack web application. The application includes a well-designed component hierarchy, a functional database, an API helper, RESTful routing, authentication, a user profile, and in-progress applications. The application also allows a user to edit their profile, view a list of companies and jobs, and apply to jobs.

See the code in my [Github repository](https://github.com/mlauren77/Jobly/tree/deploy)
