As a graduate of the comprehensive full-stack software engineering bootcamp provided by Springboard at the University of Massachusetts Global, I bring to bear more than 800 hours of rigorous curriculum training. I showcased my acumen in full-stack development through my capstone project - "Novel Pursuit". This full-stack web application leverages the Open Library API, Node.js, and React to offer users the ability to search, save, and manage their favorite books. It integrates secure user authentication features, from signup and login to session maintenance, thus personalizing each user's experience. This project stands as a testament to my proficiency in full-stack web development and my commitment to creating applications that are as dynamic as they are user-friendly.

In a parallel strand of my academic journey, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from Capella University and an Associate Degree in Nursing from Denver College of Nursing. This journey through the demanding field of healthcare has not only granted me a profound understanding of the industry but also cultivated invaluable skills that shine in high-pressure and fast-paced environments. As a registered nurse in diverse hospital settings, I refined my communication, teamwork, and critical thinking skills - attributes that I have found to be immensely beneficial in my software engineering pursuits.

My arsenal of technical skills includes but is not limited to, proficiency in JavaScript and Python, experience with SQL and PSQL databases, and a strong familiarity with a myriad of tools and frameworks such as RESTful APIs, Insomnia, AJAX, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Express.js, HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Node.js, Flask, React, Bootstrap, and jQuery. In addition, I am well-versed in various testing methodologies, having gained hands-on experience using tools such as Jest, SuperTest, Unit Testing, and Jasmine.
